# Welcome!

So you want to know what I am doing here? The answer is: I am building an exercise project in Svelte and Golang that builds a Meetup management system for a social network. 

Since I have just started the project, there's not much interesting to find here. However, you can take a look into the `features` directory where I describe the features this project hopes to implement.

What would you need a meetup for? Let's say you are using a social network and you have made some kind of "friends" there. You chat, you exchange pictures, you have some kind of community. Wouldn't it be nice to meet these friends in person? Once, twice, three times a year? Well, meetings like this have to be organized. There must be a host, there must be a location, there must be a date, there must be the possibility to register etc. This is what meetup management is all about.
